# No Man's Sky - Expedition Alphabet

With the release of the Beachhead Expedition, we have received more characters of the secret alphabet and we could start deciphering a lot more in the Nexus/Anomaly. This site is built to show the current characters we know about and allow people to type out words and sentences and view wha tthe text looks like in the secret alphabet.

This site was inspired by @RayReynolds tweet ![RayRenoldsInspireTweet](build/assets/img/rayReynoldsInspireTweet.jpg)

Please feel free to contact us on Twitter if you have evidence of new characters!
