# No Man's Sky - Expedition Alphabet

[![Supported by the No Man's Sky Community Developers & Designers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NMSCD/About/master/badge/purple-ftb.svg)](https://github.com/NMSCD)

With the release of the Beachhead Expedition, we have received more characters of the secret alphabet and we could start deciphering a lot more in the Nexus/Anomaly. This site is built to show the current characters we know about and allow people to type out words and sentences and view wha tthe text looks like in the secret alphabet.

This site was inspired by @RayReynolds tweet. Please feel free to contact us on Twitter if you have evidence of new characters!

# Use the Expedition Alphabet as a font!

### Using the fonts on your sites
Thanks to Github Pages, the fonts are readily available to be integrated into your sites by simply importing the relevant CSS files into them. Here is a quick and easy way toget started:


```css
/* font-family: NMSExpeditionAlphabet */
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NMSCD/expedition-alphabet/master/public/assets/font/NMSExpeditionAlphabet.css');

```

<br />

# Contribute to the Expedition Alphabet font

### FontForge
Right now the font is designed using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org). I am not sure if this is the best tool and I have tried to keep the icons consistent with the SVG files of the [Expedition Alphabet website](https://nmscd.github.io/expedition-alphabet). Good luck, have fun!
